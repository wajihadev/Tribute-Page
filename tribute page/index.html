            <p>
                Sir Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), widely known as Allama Iqbal, was a philosopher, poet, and politician in British India. 
                A visionary who inspired the Pakistan Movement, Iqbal is celebrated as the "Poet of the East" for his profound contributions to Urdu and Persian literature. 
                His poetry explores themes of self-realization, unity, and spiritual awakening.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iqbal’s famous works include *Bang-e-Dra*, *Bāl-e-Jibrīl*, and *Zarb-e-Kalim*, which continue to inspire millions across the globe. 
                His philosophy emphasized action, purpose, and a deep connection with one's faith.
